*If you haven't already followed the [setup steps]({{ "setup" | relative_url }}), complete those before continuing with this tutorial.*

The commands in this tutorial need the files in the `ansible` directory: Change to it before running the subsequent commands.

```terminal
$ cd ansible
```

# Run a one-off Ansible command

Ansible has some built-in modules for interacting with EOS devices. We can use one of them, `eos_info`, to get some information about our virtual device:

```terminal
(venv) $ ansible -i hosts.cfg eos -m eos_facts
eos | SUCCESS =ï¹¥ {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_net_all_ipv4_addresses": [
            "10.0.2.15"

```

Let's break down what's happening with this command:
  - The `ansible` part is the command we're calling. There are several other--more commonly used--commands that we'll see later.
  - The `-i hosts.cfg` part is telling Ansible to use that file for its inventory.
  - The `eos` part is specifying with host to target.
  - The `-m eos_facts` part is telling Ansible to run the eos\_facts module.
