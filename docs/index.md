This lab has several objectives:

  1. Create a working development environment on your laptop with:
     - a virtual network device
     - an environment to install tools to interact with the device
  2. Provide working examples with these tools

# Windows Note

These instructions and examples are targeted at Unix-style operating systems like Linux and macOS. If you are following along on Windows, you will need to adapt the commands appropriately.

  - You could also use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq).
  - The bash emulation that comes with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) is also sometimes a good workaround.
