We will start by setting up a virtual environment to work in using VirtualBox, Vagrant, and a virtual Arista device.

# Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization tool. This will allow us to run virtual servers and devices in a private, virtual lab.

- [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Once installed, you should be able to check the version from the command line:

```terminal
$ vboxmanage --version
6.0.8r130520
```

There is also a GUI that installs with VirtualBox for managing VMs, but we won't be using that in this lab.


# Install Vagrant
